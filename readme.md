# sponsor-sync

Synchronise sponsor times, from [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock), to a
database backend, meant to be used as a cache. Currently, only supports a PostgreSQL backend.
Designed to work together with [website](https://github.com/kraxarn/website), but use it for
whatever you want if you can find a good use for it.
